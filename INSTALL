To build, you will need to have the following tools installed:

 * GNU make
 * A C99-compatible C compiler, preferably GCC
 * the GTK+ 2.0 libraries, including development files
 * Samba 4 libraries, including development files

You can optionally build with a Samba4 build tree 
(in other words, without installing it). To do this,
point PKG_CONFIG_PATH at the .pc files in the source 
directory, for example:

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/jelmer/bzr.samba/SAMBA_4_0/source/bin/pkgconfig

To build, simply run make:

$ make

This will take care of running the configure script as well, if necessary.

To install, run "make install":

$ make install
