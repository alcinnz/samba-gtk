To build, you will need to have the following tools installed:

 * GNU make
 * A C99-compatible C compiler, preferably GCC
 * the GTK+ 2.0 libraries, including development files
 * Samba 4 libraries, including development files

Make sure to point pkg-config at the right path, for example if samba is installed in /usr/local/samba/:

$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/samba/lib/pkgconfig

To build, simply run make:

$ make

This will take care of running the configure script as well, if necessary.

To install, run "make install":

$ make install
