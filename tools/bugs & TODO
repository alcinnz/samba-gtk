pygwcrontab
-----------

Windows XP SP2:
Tested creating/modifying/deleteing schedules using utilitiy and on the server.
Dare I say, it looks like this one works perfectly!

-Added refresh on F5
-Connect dialog is now displayed first.

Windows Vista Home Premium:
-'NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND' error when connecting, happens on line 40 in __init__()
-unable to connect



pygwregedit
-----------

Windows XP SP2:
-problems listed before were because of missing constants. This has been fixed now.
-Getting keys happens in alphabetical order, which a few more (seemingly random) keys coming last. Not a bug, just something I noticed. (FIXED)


Windows Vista Home Premium:
-'NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND' error when connecting, returned from line 45 in __init__()
-unable to connect

TODO:
-Implement the enter key (requires adding a function and moving stuff around, requires a bit of time)
-make adding only 4bits (one hex character) impossible in the hex editor?
-refresh_keys_tree_view() is less robust now since putting the root keys in order. Fix this once you know more python :)


What works & fixed problems:
listing, adding, deleting, editing. Everything seems to work correctly, but could be improved
-editing a value says it was updated in the status bar, even if the user pressed cancel (FIXED)
-fixed everything in the REG_BINARY editor. Took a long time to get it right, but it's finally done!



pygwsam
-------

Windows XP SP2:
-passwords are not updated
-"User must change password at next logon" option is never updated on the server. Utility displays correct value, but is never able change it.
	-enabling "password never expires" does disable "user must change password" on the server as expected. However, disabling "password never expires" will once again enable "user must change password" if it was previously enabled on the server. 
	-flags are correct when sent to and accepted from the server, it appears the changes are simply rejected.
	-changing security settings have no effect
	
-using UserLogonInformation (lvl 3) always returns Invalid information class, even if no changes were made
-using UserAccountInformation (lvl 5) always returns Invalid information class, even if no changes were made
-using UserAllInformation (lvl 21) always returns Unexpected information received, even if no changes were made
	-Attempting to return field 'allow_password_change' causes this error (type: NTTIME, long?)
		-This field is of type long but only accepts vales of type int; makes me scratch my head
	-Attempting to return field 'force_password_change' causes this error (type: NTTIME, long?)
		-This field is of type long but only accepts vales of type int

	-Attempting to return field 'bad_pwd_count' causes 'Access denied' error (makes sense, should have been obvious really)
	-Attempting to return field 'last_logoff' causes 'Access denied' error 
	-Attempting to return field 'last_logon' causes 'Access denied' error 
	-Attempting to return field 'last_password_change' causes 'Access denied' error 
	-Attempting to return field 'num_logins' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to return field 'owf_pass' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to return field 'private_data' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to return field 'sec_desc' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to change the user's RID causes 'Unexpected information received' error (would it make more sense if it was access_denied? But who understands MS anyways)
	

	
-"user cannot change password" option isn't read properly from server
-"user cannot change password" option isn't updated on the server
	-It doesn't change any of the acct_flags, this is gonna be tricky
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.allow_password_change...
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.parameters
	-not in samr_UserInfo20.UserParametersInformation
		
-Groups arn't displayed properly, only the "none" group appears.
-Access denied when attempted to create a new user group (also possibly why groups arn't listed?)
-

Windows Vista Home Premium: 
-Able to view users but not create or edit anything. Possibly because it's home premium which doesn't allow this kind of advanced editing through it's own utilities
	-creating/editing doesn't work through windows' remote management either. I'm almost certain this isn't supported by Home Premium.
-Groups arn't displayed properly, only the "none" group appears.


TODO list:
-refresh should unselect any selected users/groups. Not sure how to do that, no luck so far.


What works & finished bugfixes:
-displaying list of users and refreshing (Implemented refresh on F5)
-deleting users
-modifying user home DIR, login scripts, home path, and home DIR drive letter.
-connecting via RCP over SMB over TCP/IP (access denided without SMB)
-"user cannot change password" option doesn't disable must_change_password option (FIXED)
-description field is ignored when creating a new user, but works when updated a current user (FIXED)
-options are ignored when creating a new user: must_change_password and account_disabled are always enabled, others always disabled. (FIXED)
-





pygwsvcctl
----------

Windows XP SP2:
-Access denied error when fetching services, but still displays a list (maybe some are missing? -a quick count says no, may be inaccurate)
-NT_STATUS_RPC_BAD_STUB_DATA error when updating a service.
-After updating a list of services, the list should be refreshed (the utility assumes the services was updated, so list displays incorrect info if the service was not successfully updated)
-

Windows Vista Home Premium:
-"WERR_ACCESS_DENIED" when attempting to connect
-unable to connect




What works:
-start/stop services
-pause/resume services
-




All
---
-remove default server/username values
-Add argument support so they can easily be launched from command line
-remove references to samba.dcerpc.misc when no longer needed
-Test on Windows 7!
