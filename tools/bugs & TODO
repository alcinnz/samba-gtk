pygwcrontab
-----------

Tested creating/modifying/deleteing schedules using utilitiy and on the server.
Dare I say, it looks like this one works perfectly!

-Added refresh on F5
-Connect dialog is now displayed first.




pygwregedit
-----------

-unable to get any sub key listings (only able to get the first 5 keys)
-selecting any key returns an error, selecting HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT causes a Fatal python error: deallocating None (error seems to happen outside of our code, maybe in the GTK code)
-




pygwsam
-------

-passwords are not updated
-"User must change password at next logon" option is never updated on the server. Utility displays correct value, but is never able change it.
	-flags are correct when sent to and accepted from the server, it appears the changes are simply rejected.
-"user cannot change password" option isn't read properly from server
-"user cannot change password" option isn't updated on the server
	-It doesn't change any of the acct_flags, this is gonna be tricky
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.allow_password_change...
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.parameters
	-not in samr_UserInfo20.UserParametersInformation
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.
		-samr_UserInfo21.fields_present = 0xffffff so all fields should be accepted
-Groups arn't displayed properly, only the "none" group appears.
-Access denied when attempted to create a new user group (also possibly why groups arn't listed?)
-


TODO list:
-refresh should unselect any selected users/groups. Not sure how to do that, no luck so far.


What works & finished bugfixes:
-displaying list of users and refreshing (Implemented refresh on F5)
-deleting users
-modifying user home DIR, login scripts, home path, and home DIR drive letter.
-connecting via RCP over SMB over TCP/IP (access denided without SMB)
-"user cannot change password" option doesn't disable must_change_password option (FIXED)
-description field is ignored when creating a new user, but works when updated a current user (FIXED)
-options are ignored when creating a new user: must_change_password and account_disabled are always enabled, others always disabled. (FIXED)
-



pygwsvcctl
----------

-Access denied error when fetching services, but still displays a list (maybe some are missing? -a quick count says no, may be inaccurate)
-NT_STATUS_RPC_BAD_STUB_DATA error when updating a service.
-After updating a list of services, the list should be refreshed (the utility assumes the services was updated, so list displays incorrect info if the service was not successfully updated)
-





What works:
-start/stop services
-pause/resume services
-




All

-remove default server/username values
