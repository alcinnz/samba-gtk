Windows XP SP2:
Tested creating/modifying/deleteing schedules using utilitiy and on the server.
Dare I say, it looks like this one works perfectly!

Windows Vista Home Premium:
-'NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND' error when connecting, happens on line 40 in __init__()
-unable to connect







pygwsam
-------

Windows XP SP2:
-passwords are not updated
-"User must change password at next logon" option is never updated on the server. Utility displays correct value, but is never able change it.
	-enabling "password never expires" does disable "user must change password" on the server as expected. However, disabling "password never expires" will once again enable "user must change password" if it was previously enabled on the server. 
	-flags are correct when sent to and accepted from the server, it appears the changes are simply rejected.
	-changing security settings have no effect
	
-using UserLogonInformation (lvl 3) always returns Invalid information class, even if no changes were made
-using UserAccountInformation (lvl 5) always returns Invalid information class, even if no changes were made
-using UserAllInformation (lvl 21) always returns Unexpected information received, even if no changes were made
	-Attempting to return field 'allow_password_change' causes this error (type: NTTIME, long?)
		-This field is of type long but only accepts vales of type int; makes me scratch my head
	-Attempting to return field 'force_password_change' causes this error (type: NTTIME, long?)
		-This field is of type long but only accepts vales of type int

	-Attempting to return field 'bad_pwd_count' causes 'Access denied' error (makes sense, should have been obvious really)
	-Attempting to return field 'last_logoff' causes 'Access denied' error 
	-Attempting to return field 'last_logon' causes 'Access denied' error 
	-Attempting to return field 'last_password_change' causes 'Access denied' error 
	-Attempting to return field 'num_logins' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to return field 'owf_pass' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to return field 'private_data' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to return field 'sec_desc' causes 'Access denied' error
	-Attempting to change the user's RID causes 'Unexpected information received' error (would it make more sense if it was access_denied? But who understands MS anyways)
	

	
-"user cannot change password" option isn't read properly from server
-"user cannot change password" option isn't updated on the server
	-It doesn't change any of the acct_flags, this is gonna be tricky
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.allow_password_change...
	-not in samr_UserInfo21.parameters
	-not in samr_UserInfo20.UserParametersInformation
		
-Groups arn't displayed properly, only the "none" group appears.
-Access denied when attempted to create a new user group (also possibly why groups arn't listed?)
-

Windows Vista Home Premium: 
-Able to view users but not create or edit anything. Possibly because it's home premium which doesn't allow this kind of advanced editing through it's own utilities
	-creating/editing doesn't work through windows' remote management either. I'm almost certain this isn't supported by Home Premium.
-Groups arn't displayed properly, only the "none" group appears.



TODO list:
# TODO: assign keyboard shortcuts

What works & finished bugfixes:
-displaying list of users and refreshing (Implemented refresh on F5)
-deleting users
-modifying user home DIR, login scripts, home path, and home DIR drive letter.
-connecting via RCP over SMB over TCP/IP (access denided without SMB)
-"user cannot change password" option doesn't disable must_change_password option (FIXED)
-description field is ignored when creating a new user, but works when updated a current user (FIXED)
-options are ignored when creating a new user: must_change_password and account_disabled are always enabled, others always disabled. (FIXED)

pygwregedit
-----------

Windows XP SP2:
-problems listed before were because of missing constants. This has been fixed now.
-Getting keys happens in alphabetical order, which a few more (seemingly random) keys coming last. Not a bug, just something I noticed. (FIXED)


Windows Vista Home Premium:
-'NT_STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND' error when connecting, returned from line 45 in __init__()
-unable to connect


TODO:
-Add support for REG_NONE type values, currently they are ignored and a warning is printed
-calls to ls_key should append new keys to the key tree view
-Add an option to fetch everything (view -> fetch everything)
-Implement find_next
-split ls_key function into two parts: one for keys and one for values
-move error handling outside of ls_key()
-Implement move_key()
-assign keyboard shortcuts
-implement import/export
-implement permissions
-
-make adding only 4bits (one hex character) impossible in the hex editor?
-clean up ls_hey(), it's a bit of a mess!








pygwsvcctl
----------

Windows XP SP2:
-Access denied error when fetching services, but still displays a list (maybe some are missing? -a quick count says no, may be inaccurate)
-

Windows Vista Home Premium:
-"WERR_ACCESS_DENIED" when attempting to connect
-unable to connect


TODO:
-Unable to update services
	-NT_STATUS_RPC_BAD_STUB_DATA error
	-happens when sending back the new service info. I checked the data and it looks right. (This is hard to troubleshoot because you can't send partial data back so you can't test each field to see if it's the cause of the problem)
	-SvcCtlPipeManager.update_service() line 78
-After updating a list of services, the list should be refreshed (the utility assumes the services was updated, so list displays incorrect info if the service was not successfully updated)
# TODO: assign keyboard shortcuts








All
---
-remove default server/username values
-Add argument support so they can easily be launched from command line
-remove references to samba.dcerpc.misc when no longer needed
-Test on Windows 7!
