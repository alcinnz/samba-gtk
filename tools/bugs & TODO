Tested creating/modifying/deleteing schedules using utilitiy and on the server. All changes are reflected correctly on both utility and server.
Dare I say, it looks like this one works perfectly!

-Added refresh on F5

-passwords are not updated
-description field is ignored when creating a new user, but works when updated a current user
-options are ignored when creating a new user: must_change_password and account_disabled are always enabled, others always disabled.
	-SAMPipeManager.fetch_user() always returns flags 0x20015 for a new user (option must_change_pass & [unknown?] lower 4 flags)
	-SAMPipeManager.fetch_user() always returns a blank description
-"User must change password at next logon" option is never updated on the server. Utility displays correct value, but is never able changes it.
-"user cannot change password" option doesn't disable must_change_password option (FIXED)
-"user cannot change password" option isn't read properly from server
-"user cannot change password" option isn't updated on the server
-"account is locked out" option is not saved
-Groups arn't displayed properly, only the "none" group appears.
-Access denied when attempted to create a new user group (possibly why groups arn't listed?)
-


-TODO: account locked out does get updated in query_info_to_user() ?
-TODO: implement policies functionality
-TODO: cannot_change_password in update_user() ?

my TODO list:
-test "user cannot change password", maybe not be updated in query_info_to_user()
-refresh should unselect any selected users/groups. Not sure how to do that, so far I've always got it wrong.

What works completely:
-displaying list of users and refreshing (Implemented refresh on F5)
-deleting users
-modifying user home DIR, login scripts, home path, and home DIR drive letter.
-connecting via RCP over SMB over TCP/IP (access denided without SMB)
